<p><h3>Inheritance</h3>Inheritance in Java is the method to create a hierarchy between classes by inheriting from other classes.
 Java Inheritance is transitive - so if Sedan extends Car and Car extends Vehicle, then Sedan is also inherited from the Vehicle class.
 The Vehicle becomes the superclass of both Car and Sedan.</p><br>
